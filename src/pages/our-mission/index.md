Hackertunity, Inc. is a non-profit in the process of being established. We’re based in California-- many of us with roots in the Antelope Valley. Our mission:

**To break cycles of poverty, empower at-risk populations, and diversify the computer science field by providing training and resources for building community-owned technological solutions.**

Essentially, we want to give people who could really use it an opportunity to jumpstart a new career in tech. We plan to partner with local high schools, targeting at-risk students in the Antelope Valley of Southern California. We will teach them how to build websites over the summer. Then we will host a hackathon—an event where they will each code a website in partnership with local businesses.

In 2021, we are focusing on developing the curriculum, running an initial proof-of-concept (with board and committee members acting as students), ironing out the process, and establishing partnerships with schools and businesses.

In the summer of 2022, we plan to host our first class + hackathon for five high school students.
