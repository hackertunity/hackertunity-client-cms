Hackertunity, Inc. is a non-profit. Weâ€™re based in California-- many of us with roots in the Antelope Valley. Our mission:

**To educate at-risk populations and diversify the computer science field by providing training and resources.**

Essentially, we want to give people who could really use it an opportunity to jumpstart a new career in tech. We plan to partner with local high schools, targeting under-served students in the Antelope Valley of Southern California. We will teach them how to code and build websites over the summer. 

In 2021, we focused on developing the curriculum, ran an initial proof-of-concept with adult students, and ironed out the process.

We are now establishing partnerships with schools and businesses. During winter break in 2022, we plan to teach the curriculum to our first class of high school students.
