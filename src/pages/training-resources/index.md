      A career in desktop support is a great starting point for people who want
      to launch a career in the technology sector. When you think desktop
      support, think about how you might call IT to help with an issue, or a
      company plan for managing those pesky Windows updates.  

      This is a great option for people who like to fiddle with computer settings, learn new software, or get the latest gadgets. But if that doesn't sound like you, there's no need to fret: Google search becomes any desk top support technician's best friend.

  - categoryName: IT Network Engineering Careers
    categoryOverview: >-
      A career as a Network Engineer is great for someone who wants to have a
      lot of options within the tech industry. A network is any collection of
      devices that can communicate with each other. Your printer and your
      computer share a network; if you log in to an intranet at work, that's a
      network; even the Internet itself can be considered a network. Because of
      this, Network Engineers are a cornerstone in any IT department and build
      the foundation for a safe and secure network.


      The cool thing about network engineering is that you don't have to have a super technical mind to start with; you just need to be curious about how things connect and be able to turn a big picture into small details.
