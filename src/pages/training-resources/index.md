      A career in desktop support is a great starting point for people who want
      to launch a career in the technology sector. When you think desktop

      company plan for managing those pesky Windows updates.

      This is a great option for people who like to fiddle with computer settings, learn new software, or get the latest gadgets. But if that doesn't sound like you, there's no need to fret: Google search becomes any desk top support technician's best friend.
